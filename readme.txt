Use your favorite Dashboard color scheme on the front end admin bar.

== Description ==

Version 3.8 brought a lot of visual changes, one being the ability to choose from eight color schemes for the Dashboard. However, on the front end, the toolbar is always shown with its default color, not matching your color choice.

This plugin simply allows you to use your favorite color scheme on the front end admin bar.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `admin-bar-color` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it!
